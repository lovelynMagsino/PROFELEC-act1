          <h2>Student Subject Course</h2>
          <p>A student subject course, also commonly referred to as a "course," "subject," or "class," is a unit of study within an academic curriculum that focuses on a specific topic or area of knowledge. In educational institutions such as schools, colleges, and universities, students typically enroll in courses as part of their academic programs to gain knowledge and skills in various subjects.</p>
          
            <h3>Prof Elec 2-Web System and Technologies</h3>
            <p> A web system refers to a collection of interconnected web resources (such as web pages, databases, and servers) that work together to perform a specific function or provide a particular service over the internet. These systems utilize various technologies to function effectively.
            <br><br> Web Technology refers to a range of methods and tools that are used in the process of communication between different devices via the Internet. To access web pages, a web browser is utilized. A web browser is a software application that enables the display of text, data, images, animation, and videos on the Internet. The field of web technology is rapidly increasing with new frameworks, standards, and languages.
            <br> <br> The goal of web technology is to make web-based applications work better, faster, and more enjoyable for people to use. It's always changing and improving, so we can make the most out of the internet and all the great things it offers.</p>
          

            <h3> Free Elec 2- Microcontrollers and Embedded Systems</h3>
            <p> A microcontroller is a small, self-contained computer on a single integrated circuit (IC) or chip. It consists of a central processing unit (CPU), memory (both volatile RAM for temporary data storage and non-volatile ROM or flash memory for program storage), input/output (I/O) peripherals, and various other components all embedded on a single chip. Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications and are commonly used in devices where a dedicated, specialized computing system is required.
            <br><br> An embedded system is a specialized computing system designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system. Unlike general-purpose computers, which are designed to run a variety of software applications, embedded systems are tailored to specific tasks and often operate in real-time or near real-time environments. They are typically embedded within devices or equipment and are responsible for controlling, monitoring, or interfacing with other hardware components.
            <br> <br> microcontrollers and embedded systems are interconnected concepts that play crucial roles in a wide range of electronic devices and systems, from simple consumer electronics to complex industrial automation systems.</p>
        

            <h3> Elec 4- Platforms Technologies</h3>
            <p>Platform technologies, in the context of information technology and software development, refer to foundational technologies or frameworks that provide a base upon which other applications, services, or technologies can be built. These platform technologies often offer a set of tools, libraries, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and infrastructure to facilitate the development, deployment, and management of software solutions. 
            <br> <br>Overall, platform technologies serve as the building blocks for creating software solutions, providing a robust foundation for developers to leverage and extend according to their specific requirements.</p>
           

            <h3> IT 322- Applications Development and Emerging Technologies</h3>
            <p> Application development refers to the process of creating software applications for specific platforms or devices. This typically involves designing, coding, testing, and deploying applications to fulfill particular user needs or business objectives. Emerging technologies in the context of application development refer to new or innovative technologies that are gaining traction and have the potential to significantly impact the way applications are developed, deployed, and used.
            <br> <br>These emerging technologies are shaping the landscape of application development, offering new opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and improved user experiences. Developers and businesses that stay abreast of these trends can leverage them to create cutting-edge applications and stay competitive in the rapidly evolving tech industry.</p>
          

            <h3> IT 323-Social and professional Issues</h3>
            <p> Social and professional issues refer to a wide range of ethical, legal, cultural, and organizational considerations that arise in various professional fields and social contexts. These issues often intersect with technology, business practices, and interpersonal relationships, impacting individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. Understanding and addressing these issues is essential for professionals to navigate their respective fields responsibly and ethically.
            <br> <br> Addressing social and professional issues requires a proactive approach, ongoing education, open communication, and collaboration among professionals, organizations, policymakers, and stakeholders. By recognizing and addressing these issues, professionals can contribute to positive social change, ethical business practices, and a more inclusive and sustainable future.</p>
